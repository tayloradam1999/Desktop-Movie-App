## Reason for Creation
Holberton Tulsa's React curriculum ended off on us learning about ```redux``` and ```react-redux```, and that left me thinking... what about ```@reduxjs/toolkit```?

I have read many blog posts and watched many videos covering how powerful ```@reduxjs/toolkit``` is, so I just had to get my hands dirty and try it out.
